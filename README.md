# Tic-tac-toe-assignment
A simple Tic Tac Toe game with a bit of a twist where a user is able to manually alter the settings of a game whether that be the shape of the game board or the number of pattern to win.

##Running the program
The program can be easily run through a makefile which compiles all the files that needs to be compiled in a single file and creates a executable file.
```
$ make
$ ./TicTacToe
```
